# The 1st Radical and Experiential Security Workshop (RESEC 2018)

Held in conjunction with [The 13th ACM ASIA Conference on Information, Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2018)](http://asiaccs2018.org/).

## The Focus: 
The **RESEC** workshop focuses on practical security solutions and innovative work based on experiential studies, real datasets and deployed systems. In other words, the workshop will solicit papers that would typically fall through the cracks as too practice-focused for scientific conferences, and too theoretical for system administration forums.

RESEC invites the following types of studies from researchers, academics and practitioners:

**Experiential**: studies that share insightful or puzzling observations, lessons learned, challenges, deployment considerations, observed trends and phenomena, and even data collection studies that can facilitate research in cybersecurity. 

**Radical ideas**: transformational, counter-intuitive and disruptive ideas that can re-shape the foundation of enterprise security, or provide a long-term vision and historical insights. 

**Commercially-attractive**: studies and ideas that can provide or have already provided the seed for commercial, open-source products and services.

**Negative results**: studies that demonstrate and investigate the failure of methods and approaches, especially when seen through a practical lense, and the lessons learned from these failures.

## The Context: 
There are many groups and entities that work on security from different perspectives: (a) academic researchers, (b) security practitioners, (c) entrepreneurs, (d) industrial researchers of companies, and (e) venture capitals (VC).

There is tremendous novelty, innovation, and experience that often goes to waste because it does not cross the boundaries of these groups. Clearly, there is a booming of the cybersecurity industry, high entrepreneurial activity, a dire need of effective solutions, and a dearth of security specialists in the job market. 

## Topics of Interest: 
RESEC invites submissions on all aspects of enterprise security including security risks, new security designs, in the context of enterprise environments. RESEC aims to bring together researchers in both industry and academia. RESEC particularly encourages collaborative research between research teams in industry and research groups in universities.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

1. IoT Security

2. Machine Learning in Security

3. Adversarial Machine Learning 

4. Underground Economy Study

5. Foundations of Enterprise Security

6. Lessons learned from Failed Security Practices and Case Studies in Enterprises

7. Advanced persistent attacks (APT), Software Vulnerabilities, Design Flaws

8. Malware Analysis, Code Analysis, and Reverse Engineering

9. Mobile App Security and App Market Security

10. Web Security, DDOS, Botnet

The submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three program committee members. In alignment, with the spirit of the workshop, an effort will be made to include at least one academic researcher and one industry practitioner for every paper. The workshop organizers will make acceptance decision based on the reviews provided by the program committee members. COI will be carefully handled during the reviewing process.
